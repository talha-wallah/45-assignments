/* Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

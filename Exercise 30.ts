/*Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

No Users: Add an if test to Exercise 28 to make sure the list of users is not empty.
• If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!

• Remove all of the usernames from your array, and make sure the correct message is printed.
